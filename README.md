# What is this?

This is esx_ambulancejob. I have modified this script so that it has the /heal command built into it, knocking out the need for esx_basicneeds and therefore lowering required resource count. It also has the ability to spawn at a redzone by using F, which is configurable in the config.lua

# Installation

- Drag `esx_ambulancejob` into your [esx] directory.
- Run esx_ambulabcejob.sql and import the data into your Database.
- Add `start esx_ambulancejob` to your server.cfg
- That's it!

# Credit

I have modified the esx_ambulancejob release from ESXCrackhead and added the /heal function to it, so thanks to ESXCrackhead!
